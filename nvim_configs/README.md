# NEOVIM_CONFIG 
---
The config folder is for the two version of the neovim (`stable` and `nightly` version), it is the config totally suits my **development environment** there , i keep updating the config according to  my needs (which suits for my development),  the reason i used to have two different config is just  to have  experience new nightly and still have old config for stable one if anything break  for current latest build (of nightly)

- Treesitter: install parsers, syntax highlighting, etc.
- LSPs: completions, refactorings, formatting, etc.
- Colorscheme: nordic(fav), still have (nightfox,tokyonight, gruvbox).
- file_explorer: nvim-tree (liked neo-tree but nvim-tree work better for me).
- auto_completion: nvim-cmp, cmp-nvim-lsp plugins , detailed menu using luasnip.
- GUI: neovide ,i like neovide
